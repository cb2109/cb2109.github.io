                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    This project aimed to determine important features of some of my family photos, so we can simulate something like Amazon/Google photos. This involved determining which data is available and how we can extract those features from different photo types (IPhone, Android, scanned). Exif data allowed me to extract a significant amount of data, such that I could begin the catagorization process, but for scanned photos in particular, I wanted to investigate some machine learning techniques such as facial recognition to extract some more data about when and maybe where the photo was taken.

                <h2>What I have achieved so far</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Backing up the photos automatically to AWS bucket from multiple locations on my computer</li>
                    <li>Exif data extraction to determine location and date of the photo</li>
                    <li>Working with a using Python types to try to help with type safety inside the project</li>
                    <li>Initial investigation into facial recognition, using a pre-tuned face extractor, to get cropped faces from the images</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Why?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Allows me to organize my photos for free.</li>
                    <li>Allows me to process the large backlog of my families photo libraries, especially from scanned images</li>
                    <li>Experiment with developing my own Python code from scratch using the newer type system, that can be used to improve code reliability</li>
                    <li>Play with facial recognition libraries in Python and developing my own classification</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>What's next</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Classifying the cropped faces into the recognized people in the photos and adding that data to the algorithm</li>
                    <li>Combining multiple known classifications to fill in gaps or provide custom additional information (e.g. if it's my family in the photo in December then give it the tag Christmas)</li>
                    <li>Storing the data in a sqllite database rather than organizing into folders, to allow recatagorization of folders</li>
                    <li>Build a UI app to sort and filter the photos for display</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>CV2: ML algorithm for classification of faces and how to apply different classification algorithms</li>
