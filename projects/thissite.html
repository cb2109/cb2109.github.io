                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    Creating this site was a chance to bring my CV to life a bit and add more detail for recruiters. 
                    As a CV is primarily a visual document I was able to use good HTML and simple but hopefully tasteful CSS to showcase my skills.
                    I also used this as an opportunity to look into more amazon hosting, as this website is hosted on Amazon CloudFront, using Route53 as the DNS and S3 as the static storage.

                <h2>What I have achieved so far</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recreated my CV in a HTML page, using some javascript elements and page transitions to add more information than 1 A4 sheet allows</li>
                    <li>Taken the time to craft some simple looking CSS to both separate my CV from the crowd, while also making it easier to read</li>
                    <li>Added larger descriptions of projects I have started, so I can show both where they are and where I want to take them</li>
                    <li>Learned a bit of bootstrap along the way, using it as my base CSS file</li>
                    <li>Worked with Chrome's Auditing tools to improve accessibility, performance and try to ensure use of best practice</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Why?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Showcasing my CV for recruiters</li>
                    <li>Having something a bit more tangible and UI based to show to potential employers</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>What's next</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improving on the general design of the site, so that key information for employers is close to the top</li>
                    <li>Ensuring I keep this site up to date both technically and with the latest projects and employment from Chris Bates</li>
                    <li>Working on finishing some of the other projects so I can have more to show</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Skills used</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Amazon products: using Amazon S3, SES, CloudFront, Route53 and Certificate Manager to set up a scalable, secure website</li>
                    <li>CSS/Bootstrap: Investigating bootstrap CSS as a base and building on that to create my own unique design. Also working on keyframes to do the page transitions with as little JS as possible</li>
                    <li>JS: Small amounts of JS just to add the necessary touches to the site to make it feel more modern</li>
                    <li>Design: Deciding on a nice motif (corner triangles) and picking gentle colors so that the text was readable but not aggressive on the eye. Also choosing what layouts look best to try to present a reader with the important information first and make it stick out</li>
                    <li>Git: Relearning the command line interface for git, as recently I'd been using one built into IntelliJ. I'd forgotten how nice it is to manage this sort of thing.</li>
                </ul>
