                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    This Java project gave me the opportunity to revisit some image processing algorithms.
                    A lot of the work here was studying the theory behind them, as well as tweaking parameters to create good line detection within a set of sample images.<br>
                    The code is hosted on github <a href="https://github.com/cb2109/imageprocessing" target="new">here</a>.

                <h2>What I have achieved so far</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implemented a Gaussian filter that blurs the image by averaging out each pixel with the neighboring pixels</li>
                    <li>Implemented a generic convolution transformation, which applies a small matrix to each pixel in an image to get a new summed value for the pixel. This can be used to detect intensity and direction of edges (e.g. Robert's Cross filter)</li>
                    <li>Implemented a full Canny Edge detector, which uses a Gaussian filter and Sobel edge detector (convolution) to pull out edges. Then it uses "non-maximal suppression" to only take pixels that are considered at the top of the edge</li>
                    <li>Tweaked some parameters such as the size/deviation of the gaussian filter and changing the parameters on a high/low filter we apply on the image. This allowed us to get better image/edge outputs</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Practicing Java as well as revisiting coding complex algorithms</li>
                    <li>Revising image processing and line detection algorithms, as the topic was quite interesting at university and has many exciting applications (e.g. medical, robotics, categorization of images)</li>
                    <li>It's quite a nice visual project, that you can actually show people the output of (examples to come!)</li>
                </ul>

            <section>
                <h2>What's next</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implementing the Hough transform algorithm to detect possible lines</li>
                    <li>Adapting the Hough transform to work with oval shapes</li>
                    <li>Revisit machine learning with the aim of identifying faces within images</li>
                </ul>
