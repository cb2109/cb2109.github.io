                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    This Java project leverages less-used sorting methods to try to work on faster ways of sorting large data sets than the standard sorts.<br>
                    The code is hosted on github <a href="https://github.com/cb2109/DistributedSorting" target="new">here</a>.

                <h2>What I have achieved so far</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Started introducing basic unit tests to test that the data comes out sorted and that restrictions on building the various components are enforced with appropriate exceptions</li>
                    <li>Project structure is in place to run a basic sorting algorithm across the data</li>
                    <li>The top layer of bucket sort is in place, which would distribute the data to the nodes/threads to do the sorting</li>
                    <li>Sub nodes successfully sort the data using the inbuilt sort</li>
                    <li>We combine the data back into a Java stream, which is then tested to be validly sorted</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Why?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>A good project to experiment with Java streams and revisit concurrency in Java 8/9</li>
                    <li>Creating a nice library for solving these sort of problems, where the data distribution is known</li>
                    <li>It allows me to re-look at sorting algorithms for study purposes</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>What's next</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Transferring all the sorting into a nested bucket sort, using this method we can better balance the data for more complex distributions</li>
                    <li>Add more complex data distributions like Gaussian distributions or ways to customize the distribution to your own design</li>
                    <li>Add tests for performance versus a standard built-in sorting algorithm</li>
                    <li>Properly distribute the child sorters as threads and connect them via a message queue of some sort</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Skills used</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Java: Building this into a nice easy to configure library for others to use, while also toying with Java 9's new features including streams. Finally looking into message queue solutions and multi-threading</li>
                    <li>Algorithms: Investigating different sorting algorithms and figuring out how to use data distributions to plan a more focused and optimal sort</li>
                    <li>Distributed processing/concurrency: Reading into and implementing distribution solutions and applying care with concurrency to create a robust and quick solution</li>
                    <li>Unit tests: Adding unit tests to ensure every part of the code is tested. Trying to do test driven development at a high level to ensure that the library is focused around how it is configured and not just a collection of classes</li>
                </ul>
