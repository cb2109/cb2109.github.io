                        <li>
                            Created a MSAccess SQL to PostgreSQL interpreter to support both legacy and current systems while migrating databases. Performing this accurately and efficiently required a deep understanding of SQL and interpreter technology. This had to be written in PHP and vbscript.

                        <li>
                            Developed and administered an event based auto-emailing system in Perl. As a legacy system it needed to be merged in to one consistent, commented code base. Maintaining this system required an understanding of mail infrastructure and how spam scores are calculated.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Improved coding practices by introducing a code linter to SVN commits of PHP to improve code quality and introduced a build server for managing development and production code.

                        <li>
                            Recruited an intern from a top university and managed three developer interns through several successful projects. Two of the interns returned to work this Christmas during their break.

                        <li>
                            Managed SSL certificates and policies to ensure we were using the most appropriate cryptographic protocols.

                        <li>
                            Automated and improved server/developer setup into batch files to reduce onboarding and server set up times.
